## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a deep passion for AI and a background in Finance. I believe in understanding both the theory and practical applications of technology—because yes, this knowledge can make you money!

This repository documents my own learning journey from basics to cutting-edge NLP, structured the way I'm learning it through my university program. I'm making it public because:

1. Learning publicly builds community and multiplies growth
2. Many NLP resources are scattered or too theoretical without practical implementation
3. I want to create the resource I wish existed when I started

> "Strong foundations in understanding, even in things that may seem basic, is what guarantees full comprehension of more complex topics."
