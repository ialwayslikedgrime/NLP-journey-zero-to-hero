about me, why this repo
I am a computer science student with a deep interest for AI, and that has the luck to attend a university course very innovative, focused on AI
this repo is built to give everyone else the opportunity to learn in the same constructed way I am doing in university, without having to attend one.
it has the goal to:
1) make a costructed path of the scattered resources (big overwhelming books, papers, online resources such as those on HugggingFace, Google) as I get along them - they are very scattered and often theoretical
2) it aims to give that deep theoretical background, which I personally love, but implemented with practical code exercises created by me, to apply in real-life
3) aims to suggest project ideas and exercises to make sure you understood the concepts and are able to 






 computer science student with a deep interest for AI, understanding things deeply yet applying them in practice and in Code. 
I am personally convinced that trtying first hand to apply concepts  in practice deeps understanding and makes you deeply integrate them in you. 

for this purpose, I choose to use mainly Jupyter Notebooks. I love delving into the theory and math behind things, to understand them deeply in what they mean
and see and use them in practice


I truly believe in building strong foundations in understanding. strong foundations, even in things that may seem banali is what guarantees
full understanding of more complex items

I am formally enrolled in a computer science course. In fact, this is the journey of studying I am down, from 0 to expert

why learning publicly ?

I think there are not many resources who start from 0 to expert.
therefore I am creating this resource for myself first, to make sense and create a clear path of the scattered resources (books, papers) I am reading first
and to implement basic code I create myself, because I often find theory with no code and no real, actual application.

I have a Financial background, and I also love seeeing the application of concepts in the real world... this shit makes money !!


put a star, clone the repo. Stay tuned for the updates, I am learning and updating day by day and you are invited to join the journey!
