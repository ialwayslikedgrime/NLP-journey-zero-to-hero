    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goals of this notebook\n",
    "- Understand the basics of vector semantics\n",
    "- Learn the difference between sparse and dense vector representations\n",
    "- Master key concepts like term-document matrices, word-context matrices, and weighting schemes\n",
    "- Explore Word2Vec and how neural embeddings work\n",
    "- Implement simple code examples for these concepts\n",
    "- Apply and test your knowledge through interactive exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Vector Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **What is Vector Semantics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector semantics is a powerful way to represent word meaning in natural language processing. The core idea is surprisingly simple yet profound:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A word's meaning can be represented as a point in a multi-dimensional space - a **vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach, also called the **distributional hypothesis**, is based on the intuition that words with similar meanings tend to occur in similar contexts. As linguist J.R. Firth famously said in 1957:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" often appear in similar contexts (pet, animal, fur, etc.), so their vector representations should be close to each other in our semantic space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Curiosity: From Philosophy to Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that \"meaning is use\" actually has philosophical roots in Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work. Rather than trying to define words with formal logical definitions, Wittgenstein suggested that \"the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\" This philosophical insight eventually led to computational approaches to semantics!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Why Vectors for Words?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why represent words as vectors? There are several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantifiable similarity**: We can measure how similar two words are by measuring the distance between their vectors\n",
    "2. **Continuous representation**: Instead of discrete, binary relationships, we get graduated similarities\n",
    "3. **Automatic learning**: These relationships can be learned from large text corpora\n",
    "4. **Computation-friendly**: Vector operations are efficient and well-supported\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Try it yourself: Word similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about these word pairs. Which ones seem most similar in meaning?\n",
    "- cat / dog\n",
    "- cat / table\n",
    "- run / sprint\n",
    "- happy / sad\n",
    "- happy / joyful\n",
    "\n",
    "If you thought cat/dog, run/sprint, and happy/joyful were the most similar pairs, you're already thinking like a vector semantics system! Later, we'll see how our algorithms capture these similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. From Words to Vectors: The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Two Types of Vector Representations**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of vector representations for words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sparse vectors**: Very high-dimensional with mostly zeros\n",
    "   - Dimensions often = vocabulary size (tens of thousands)\n",
    "   - Each dimension has a clear interpretation\n",
    "   - Examples: one-hot vectors, tf-idf, PPMI matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dense vectors**: Lower-dimensional with mostly non-zero values\n",
    "   - Dimensions typically range from 50-1000\n",
    "   - Dimensions don't have clear interpretations\n",
    "   - Examples: word2vec, GloVe, fastText\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Representing Words in Vector Space**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the simplest approach to understand how we might represent words as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest vector representation is a **one-hot vector**:\n",
    "- Create a vector with length = vocabulary size\n",
    "- Set element i to 1 if it corresponds to word i\n",
    "- Set all other elements to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with vocabulary [cat, dog, house, book, run]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"cat\" = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "- \"dog\" = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "- \"book\" = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ Challenge: One-Hot Encoding Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of a major limitation of one-hot encoding for representing word meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to see the answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding treats all words as equally different from each other! The distance between any two different words is exactly the same, so we don't capture any notion of semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \"cat\" and \"dog\" are just as different as \"cat\" and \"algorithm\" according to one-hot encoding, which doesn't match our intuition about meaning.\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Building Better Vectors: Co-occurrence Counts**\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture similarity, we need to look at how words are used in context. A simple but powerful approach is to count **co-occurrences** - how often words appear near each other in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of co-occurrence matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term-Document Matrix**: Rows = words, Columns = documents\n",
    "2. **Term-Term Matrix** (or Word-Context Matrix): Rows = target words, Columns = context words\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each one!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Term-Document Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **The Term-Document Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "A term-document matrix represents words based on which documents they appear in:\n",
    "- Each row represents a word (term)\n",
    "- Each column represents a document\n",
    "- Each cell value shows how many times that word occurs in that document\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with documents about \"pets\", \"cooking\", and \"sports\":\n",
    "\n",
    "|          | doc_pets | doc_cooking | doc_sports |\n",
    "|----------|----------|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| cat      | 5        | 0           | 0          |\n",
    "| dog      | 7        | 0           | 0          |\n",
    "| flour    | 0        | 4           | 0          |\n",
    "| recipe   | 0        | 6           | 0          |\n",
    "| ball     | 1        | 0           | 8          |\n",
    "| team     | 0        | 0           | 5          |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how words that appear in similar documents will have similar vectors. \"Cat\" and \"dog\" both appear in the pets document, making their vectors similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📖 **The Limits of Sparse Vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "While PPMI and TF-IDF are powerful, they have limitations:\n",
    "- Very high dimensionality (vocabulary size)\n",
    "- Sparse (mostly zeros)\n",
    "- Need huge amounts of data to get good estimates for rare words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dense vectors** (embeddings) address these issues:\n",
    "- Lower dimensionality (typically 50-1000)\n",
    "- Dense (mostly non-zero values)\n",
    "- Better at capturing synonymy and other relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Word2Vec: Learning Dense Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is a family of models that learn word embeddings by training a shallow neural network on a simple prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram model works by:\n",
    "1. Taking a word and predicting context words that appear near it\n",
    "2. Learning word vectors that are good at this prediction task\n",
    "3. Using these vectors as our word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is: \"Given a target word, is word c likely to appear nearby?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Curiosity: Self-Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "A revolutionary insight in Word2Vec is the use of \"self-supervision\" - creating a supervised task from unlabeled text. The model uses each word's context as its own supervision signal!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common Word2Vec algorithm is skip-gram with negative sampling:\n",
    "1. For each target word, we have positive examples (actual context words)\n",
    "2. We also create negative examples by randomly sampling words from the vocabulary\n",
    "3. We train a binary classifier to distinguish real context words from random words\n",
    "4. The weights learned by this classifier become our word embeddings\n",

    "### ⚡ Challenge: Small Dataset Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that our Word2Vec model isn't very good with this tiny dataset. In real applications, Word2Vec is typically trained on billions of words! What kinds of problems do you see with our small model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **How Skip-gram Actually Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the mathematics behind skip-gram:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have two embeddings for each word:\n",
    "   - Target embeddings (when word is the center word)\n",
    "   - Context embeddings (when word is a context word)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For a target word $w$ and context word $c$, the probability of $c$ being a real context word is:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$P(+|w, c) = \\sigma(c \\cdot w) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-c \\cdot w}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $c \\cdot w$ is the dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The training objective maximizes the probability of real context words and minimizes the probability of random \"negative sample\" words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Curiosity: Word Analogies\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fascinating properties of Word2Vec embeddings is their ability to capture analogies through vector arithmetic. The classic example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} \\approx \\text{queen}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the vector difference between \"king\" and \"man\" captures something like a \"royalty\" relationship, which when added to \"woman\" gives us \"queen\".\n",

    "## 7. Applications and Limitations of Vector Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Applications of Vector Semantics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are used in a wide variety of NLP tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finding similar words** (thesaurus creation)\n",
    "2. **Document similarity** (for information retrieval, plagiarism detection)\n",
    "3. **Recommendation systems** (suggesting similar content)\n",
    "4. **Machine translation** (mapping words between languages)\n",
    "5. **Sentiment analysis** (understanding positive/negative opinions)\n",
    "6. **Named entity recognition** (identifying proper nouns)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Bias in Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "One major issue with word embeddings is that they capture and amplify biases present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of problematic analogies found in embeddings:\n",
    "- man : computer_programmer :: woman : homemaker\n",
    "- father : doctor :: mother : nurse\n",
    "\n",
    "These biases aren't just theoretical problems - they can lead to:\n",
    "1. **Allocational harms**: Unfair allocation of resources (e.g., job search algorithms favoring men for certain positions)\n",
    "2. **Representational harms**: Demeaning or ignoring certain social groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Curiosity: Debiasing Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have developed techniques to reduce bias in embeddings, such as:\n",
    "1. Identifying and removing the \"gender direction\" in the vector space\n",
    "2. Creating new training objectives that specifically reduce bias\n",
    "\n",
    "However, completely eliminating bias remains an open problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **Contextual vs. Static Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Static embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe have one major limitation: a word has the same embedding regardless of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the word \"bank\" might refer to:\n",
    "- A financial institution\n",
    "- The side of a river\n",
    "- To tilt an aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern NLP systems use **contextual embeddings** (like BERT, GPT, etc.) that produce different representations for words based on their surrounding context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Review and Practical Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Summary of Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector semantics** represents words as points in a multidimensional space\n",
    "2. **Sparse representations** (TF-IDF, PPMI) directly count co-occurrences\n",
    "3. **Dense representations** (Word2Vec, GloVe) learn lower-dimensional embeddings that capture semantic relationships\n",
    "4. **Similarity measures** like cosine similarity quantify how related words are\n",
    "5. **Applications** include document similarity, word similarity, and many downstream NLP tasks\n",
    "6. **Limitations** include bias and the inability of static embeddings to handle context\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Practical Tips for Working with Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don't reinvent the wheel**: Use pre-trained embeddings for most tasks\n",
    "2. **Choose the right embeddings**: Different embeddings are optimized for different tasks\n",
    "3. **Fine-tune when needed**: You can further train pre-trained embeddings on your specific data\n",
    "4. **Be aware of bias**: Consider debiasing techniques for sensitive applications\n",
    "5. **Consider contextual embeddings**: For state-of-the-art performance, use contextual models like BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Final quiz: Test your understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What's the main difference between sparse and dense word vectors?\n",
    "2. Why is TF-IDF better than raw word counts for document similarity?\n",
    "3. What problem does PPMI solve compared to raw co-occurrence counts?\n",
    "4. How does Word2Vec learn word embeddings without explicit supervision?\n",
    "5. Name one way that bias can manifest in word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click to see answers</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sparse vectors have mostly zeros and dimensions equal to vocabulary size, while dense vectors have mostly non-zero values and lower dimensionality (50-1000).\n",
    "2. TF-IDF downweights common words that appear in many documents, focusing instead on distinctive words that characterize a document.\n",
    "3. PPMI measures how much more frequently words co-occur than expected by chance, reducing the impact of common words that co-occur with everything.\n",
    "4. Word2Vec uses self-supervision - it creates a prediction task (predicting context words given a target word) and uses the text itself as training data.\n",
    "5. Examples include gender stereotypes in occupation words (e.g., programmer associated with male terms), racial biases in sentiment associations, or cultural stereotypes.\n",
